### Logging levels

    LS_DEBUG_LEVEL=10
    LS_INFO_LEVEL=20
    LS_WARNING_LEVEL=30
    LS_ERROR_LEVEL=40
    LS_CRITICAL_LEVEL=50

The default logging level is `LS_WARNING_LEVEL` and the value is stored at `LS_LEVEL`. If you need debug or info message, set `LS_LEVEL` to them.

### Default levels logging functions

    LSDEBUG
    LSINFO
    LSWARNING
    LSERROR
    LSCRITICAL

All arguments supplied to these function are treated as the message. There is also a general logging function `LSLOG`:

    LSLOG 35 A message for level 35

The first parameter is the the level. You do not need to use preset levels actually, as long as the level is equal to or greater than `LS_LEVEL`, the message will be printed out.

### Changing the output target

The default `LS_OUTPUT` is set to `/dev/stdout`, you can change it to `/dev/stderr` or any filename. Note that, it overwrites the file.
